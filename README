Viscose wants to provide a simple interface to different version control or
source code management systems. I wrote this to make it easier to manage a
bunch of source code repositories from projects I try to follow. It's possible
and even probable that you have no use for it.

Installation
============

There's a single point of entry for the funcionality, which is bin/vcs. If you
want to copy or link it to your path or if you'd rather use it from where it
is, it's up to you.

In that script there are 2 variables that need to be set, though. Find the
lines,

    VCS_BIN_DIR=~/work/vcs/bin
    VCS_PLUGIN_PATH=~/work/vcs/plugins

And change the paths to match your installation. That's it!


Usage
=====

Usually,

    $ vcs <command> <arguments>...

assuming vcs is in your path.



Commands
========

* test
Identify VCS for the specified directory, or current if none specified.  This
test should not use native commands, so you don't need to have all of them
installed.

* update
synchronize working copy to latest upstream version
