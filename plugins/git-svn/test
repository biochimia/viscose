# TODO: Deal with GIT_DIR. If variable is defined. If it is defined, but empty,
#       git errors out -- so should we.
# TODO: Go up the tree and search for GIT_DIR in parent
# TODO: Ensure GIT_DIR/svn is not empty. If one accidentally runs git-svn on a
#       regular git repository, it will create this directory, breaking our
